                <p>
                    I am an openly gay, 3rd Gen Mexican American with a Bachelor of Science in Public Relations and Digital Communication. Currently, I am in a Software Engineering Coding Bootcamp at Flatiron.
                <br>
                    My coding journey actually started in my final year of college, where I took web development courses for my degree. This is where I learned about HTML, CSS, Bootstrap and basic JavaScript. After graduating college, my professional career took a bit of a pivot with the job market in Austin and this led me to my first job in tech as a Technical Support Specialist in 2020. Since working there, my coding skills grew very organically. This pushed me to looking into various bootcamps to enroll in to improve my coding skills and learn new languages.
                <br>
                    Throughout my journey, I have invested 10+ years in customer service-related experience. I am always looking for continuous growth and learning opportunities. I aim to lead/mentor others to approach business ideas with innovation, creativity and inclusivity. Feel free to connect with me!
